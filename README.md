# Coursera: Developing Data Products
The project contains the required Slidify presentation for the class project.
Following the directions on the course, I attempted to create a github-pages version of this Slidify presentation, but this is failing miserably.

So, in order to evaluate the Slidify presentation, please download the index.HTML file and view it locally.
